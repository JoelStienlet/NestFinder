# NestFinder
Finds asian hornet nests by triangulation

## How it works
Several feeding points are placed in the wild. Each feeding point is equiped with a camera that records the movements of the hornets, more precisely the direction taken by the hornets when leaving the feeding point. Then statistics are made, and the most probable direction of the nest from each feeding point is found. Finally, a simple triangulation is done to find an accuration estimate of the position of the nest.
